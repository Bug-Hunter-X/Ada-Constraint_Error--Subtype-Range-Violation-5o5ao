# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: the `Constraint_Error` exception. This exception is raised when a value is assigned to a variable that violates the constraints of its subtype.  The example shows a subtype with a limited range, and an attempt to assign a value outside that range, causing the error.

The solution shows how to handle this exception using exception handling.
